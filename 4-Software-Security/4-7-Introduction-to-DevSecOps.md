# Eng 4.7. Introduction to DevSecOps

#### **Task 1 - Introduction**

This is the first room in a new DevSecOps learning path being developed. The new path will cover:

- Introduction to DevSecOps (Secure SDLC, Environments, and Tools)
- Security of the Pipeline (Pipeline Automation, Source Code Security, Automated Code Testing, Dependency Management, CI/CD, and Environment Security)
- Security in the Pipeline (Attacking the Pipeline, Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Pipeline, Defending the Pipeline)
- Infrastructure as Code (Cloud DevOps, Secret Management, Exploiting Terraform, Exploiting Vagrant, Exploiting Docker)

#### **Task 2 - DevOps Models**

**Waterfall Model:** Traditional Waterfall development creates operational bottlenecks by locking teams into isolated sequential phases, accumulating security and functional debt until late-stage QA testing.

**Agile Model:** The Agile Model is a flexible, iterative software development framework established in the early 2000s that prioritizes adaptability, rapid delivery cycles, and collaborative principles over rigid sequential planning.

**DevOps:** DevOps is a collaborative cultural and technical philosophy that breaks down traditional silos between development, system administration, and quality assurance teams by emphasizing shared responsibility, continuous communication, and small, reversible deployments aligned directly with business priorities.

- Developers can provide resources to public clouds without depending on IT to provision infrastructure, which in the past led to weeks to months of delays.
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes automatically set up testing, staging, and production environments in the cloud or on-premises. They can be decommissioned, scaled, or re-configured as needed.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is widely used to deploy environments declaratively*, using tools like Terraform and Vagrant.
- Organisations can now provision containerised workloads dynamically using automated, adaptive processes
- The declarative approach requires that users specify the end state of the infrastructure - for example, deploy these machines in a running state directly into an environment, automating the configuration choices throughout the workflow. The software builds it and releases it with no human interaction.

#### **Task 3 - The Infinite Loop**

How does DevOps work? DevOps is **visualized as an infinite loop, describing all the comprising phases:**

![the infinite loop diagram describing a DevOps lifecycle](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61a7523c029d1c004fac97b3/room-content/538ad9f777ec0153d5d648edd4bcf65a.png)

1. **CI/CD** – In the previous task, we mentioned CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment); CI/CD deals with the frequent merging of code and adding testing in an automated manner to perform checks as new code is pushed and merged. We can test code as we push and merge thanks to a new dynamic and routine in deployment, which takes the form of minor code changes systematically and routinely. Thanks to this change in dynamic, CI/CD helps detect bugs early and decreases the effort of maintaining modular code massively, which introduces reliable rollbacks of versions/code. 
2. **INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE** (IaC) – a way to manage and provision infrastructure through code and automation. Thanks to this approach, we can reuse code used to deploy infrastructure (for example, cloud instances), which helps in consistent resource creation and management. Standard tools for IaC are terraform, vagrant, etc. We will use these tools further in the pathway as we experiment with IaC security.
3. **CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT** – This is where the state of infrastructure is managed constantly and applying changes efficiently, making it more maintainable. Thanks to this, lots of time is saved, and more visibility into how infrastructure is configured. You can use IaC for configuration management.
4. **ORCHESTRATION** – Orchestration is the automation of workflows. It helps achieve stability; for example, by automating the planning of resources, we can have fast responses whenever there is a problem (e.g., health checks failing); this can be achieved thanks to monitoring.
5. **MONITORING** – focuses on collecting data about the performance and stability of services and infrastructure. This enables faster recovery, helps with cross-team visibility, provides more data to analyze for better root-cause analysis, and also generates an automated response, as mentioned earlier.
6. **MICROSERVICES** – An architecture that breaks an application into many small services. This has several benefits, like flexibility if there is a need to scale, reduced complexity, and more options for choosing technology across microservices. We will look at these in more detail in the DevSecOps pathway.

#### **Task 4 - Shifting Left**

Shifting Left means that  DevOps teams focus on instilling security from the earliest stages in the development lifecycle and introducing a more collaborative culture between development and security.

Implementing security measures during all stages of the development lifecycle (shifting left) rather than at the end of the cycle will ensure the software is designed with security best practices built in. By detecting security flaws early in development, remediation costs are lower, and there would be no need to roll back changes as they are being addressed on time. This reduces cost, builds trust, and improves the security and quality of the product.

**Why are we shifting left**

![Shifting Left Benefits](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61a7523c029d1c004fac97b3/room-content/2078c48d1463aaf4245f2ed0d1175cab.png)

Shift-Left security is an operational philosophy that embeds security testing, risk assessment, and compliance checks early into the initial phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to eliminate post-development bottlenecks, prevent the accumulation of technical and security debt, and keep pace with rapid deployment cycles.

**Answer the questions below**

> What term is it used to describe accounting for security from the earliest stages in a development lifecycle?
> 

shift left

> What is the development approach where security is introduced from the early stages of a development lifecycle until the final stages?

#### **Task 5 - DevSecOps: Security Strikes Back**

DevSecOps is a culture-driven framework that embeds security as a shared, continuous responsibility throughout the development lifecycle through extensive automation and platform design, thereby maximizing test coverage, reducing systemic risk, simplifying compliance auditing, and preventing economic and reputational losses.

**DevSecOps Challenges**

**Security Silos:** Security, development, and operations teams work independently, reducing collaboration.
**Lack of Visibility & Prioritization:** Too many security findings make it hard to focus on critical risks.
**Stringent Processes:** Manual security procedures slow down development and deployment cycles.

**Answer the questions below**

> What DevSecOps challenge can lead to a siloed culture?
> 

Security Silos 

> What DevSecOps challenge can affect not prioritizing the right risks at the right times?
> 

Lack of visibility 

> What DevSecOps challenge stems from needlessly overcomplicated security processes?
> 

 Stringent Processes

#### **Task 6 - DevSecOps Culture**

**Promote Autonomy:** Teams take ownership of security and make decisions independently.

**Visibility & Transparency:** Security information is shared openly across teams.

**Flexibility Through Empathy:** Teams understand each other's challenges and collaborate to balance security with speed and business needs.

**Answer the questions below**

> How can you make security scalable so it's not left behind when start ups face hypergrowth or in large corporations?
> 

promote autonomy of teams

> How can you support teams in understanding risk and educating on security flaws?
> 

Visibility and Transparency

> What are key factors to successfully instill security in the development process by accounting for flexibility?
> 

Understanding and Empathy

#### **Task 7 - Conclusion**

SEC3PO, X Fighter Dev, Chewba-QA and S2-A2 have been assigned to discover minerals in nearby planets in the Galaxy. Watto, the Bug, is funding the mission by providing equipment and fuel to carry out this project. They are tasked to set a course and research these planets.  

**Background**

**Mission:** Travel to the planet with the least amount of risk possible.

**Fuel:** Accounts for 130.000 Light Years of travel

**Models:** Waterfall, Agile & DevOps

| **Planet** | **Distance from Spaceship** |
| --- | --- |
| Testooine | 125.000 Light Years |
| Hackboo | 100.000 Light Years |
| TryHothMe | 80.000 Light Years |
| Dagobug | 60.000 Light Years |

**Comic 1: Some tests have passed to go to Testooine, which was the initial decision by x fighter dev. It is decided that it is the next planet to visit.**

**Comic 2: Some tests indicated that it is a high risk to travel to Testooine; first, some tests have passed for Naboo, but S2-D2 has decided the course should be changed to Hoth.**

**Comic 3: The initial decision based on analysis by X fighter Dev is to travel to Hoth. Costs were questioned, and although Hoth is one of the closest, SEC3PO has analysed the trajectory and has set new parameters for the tests. Chewba-QA has concluded to change orbit to Dagobah based on further tests.**
