# Eng 4.3. SSDLC

#### **Task 1 - What is SSDLC?**

Secure SDLC models aim to introduce security at every stage of the SDLC.

Apart from faster development and reduction of costs, integrating security across the SDLC helps discover and reduce vulnerabilities early, reducing business risk massively. 

- Security is a constant concern, improving software quality and security constantly.
- Boosting security education and awareness: all stakeholders know each phase's security recommendations and requirements.
- Flaws are detected early before deployment, reducing the risk of getting hacked or disrupted.
- Costs are reduced, and speed increases, thanks to the early detection and resolution of vulnerabilities. Business risk, brand reputation damage, and fines that could lead to economic disaster for a company are prevented.

#### **Task 2 - Implementing SSDLC**

To help grasp what your security posture is, you can start by doing the following:

- Perform a **gap analysis** to determine what activities and policies exist in your organisation and how effective they are. For example, ensuring policies are in place (what the team does) with security procedures (how the team executes those policies).
- Create **Software Security Initiatives** (SSI) by establishing realistic and achievable goals with defined metrics for success. For example, this could be a Secure Coding Standard, playbooks for handling data, etcetera are tracked using project management tools.
- **Formalise processes** for security activities within your SSI. After starting a program or standard, it is essential to spend an operational period helping engineers get familiarised with it and gather feedback before enforcing it. When performing a gap analysis, every policy should have defined procedures to make them effective.
- **Invest in security training** for engineers as well as appropriate tools. Ensure people are aware of new processes and the tools that will come with them to operationalise them, and invest in training early, ideally before establishing / onboarding the tool.

**SSDLC Processes**

- **Risk Assessment** during the early stages of SDLC, it is essential to identify security considerations that promote a security by design approach when functional requirements are gathered in the planning and requirements stages. For example, if a user requests a blog entry from a site, the user should not be able to edit the blog or remove unnecessary input fields.
- **Threat Modelling** - is the process of identifying potential threats when there is a lack of appropriate safeguards. It is very effective when following a risk assessment and during the design stage of the SDLC, as Threat Modelling focuses on what should not happen. In contrast, design requirements state how the software will behave and interact. For example, ensure there is verification when a user requests account information.
- **Code Scanning / Review** - Code reviews can be either manual or automated. Code Scanning or automated code reviews can leverage Static and Dynamic Security testing technologies. These are crucial in the Development stages as code is being written.
- **Security Assessments - Like Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments** are a form of automated testing that can identify critical paths of an application that may lead to exploitation of a vulnerability. However, these are hypothetical as the assessment doesn't carry simulations of those attacks. Pentesting, on the other hand, identifies these flaws and attempts to exploit them to demonstrate validity. Pentests and Vulnerability Assessments are carried out during the Operations & Maintenance phase of the SDLC after a prototype of the application.

There are methodologies to apply the processes in task 5 that will help you navigate and guide you when introducing risk assessment, threat modelling, scanning and testing, and operational assurance. The following tasks will cover these processes in more detail.

Threat Modelling

#### **Task 3 - Risk Assessment**

Risk refers to the likelihood of a threat being exploited, negatively impacting a resource or the target it affects.

Risk assessment is used to determine the level of the potential threat. Risk identified in the risk assessment process can be reduced or eliminated by applying appropriate controls during the risk mitigation process. Usually, a risk assessment is followed by threat modelling, which will be explained further in the next section.

**Types of Risk Assessments**

There are several types of Risk assessments best suited for different scenarios. Qualitative Risk Assessment and Quantitative Risk Assessment


**Answer the questions below**

> What is a formula to assign a Qualitative Risk level?
> 

Severity x Likelihood

> Which type of Risk Assessment assigns numerical values to determine risk?
> 

Quantitative Risk Assessment

#### **Task 4 - Threat Modelling**

Threat modeling is a proactive, design-phase engineering process that systematically identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes potential security threats against critical assets using structured frameworks such as STRIDE, DREAD, and PASTA to establish targeted risk mitigations prior to code development.

STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial Of Service, and Elevation/Escalation of Privilege. 

- **Spoofing:** Impersonation of a user by a malicious actor, violating the authentication principle. Examples include ARP, IP, and DNS spoofing.
- **Tampering:** Modification of information by an unauthorised user, violating the integrity principle.
- **Repudiation:** Lack of accountability for actions where responsibility cannot be attributed, violating non-repudiability.
- **Information Disclosure:** Violation of confidentiality, such as in data breaches.
- **Denial of Service:** Exhaustion of resources, preventing authorised users from accessing a system, violating availability.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Gaining unauthorised access by escalating privileges, violating authorisation principles.


**DREAD**

The abbreviation DREAD stands for five questions about each potential threat: Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability. DREAD ranks threats by assigning scores based on their severity and risk probability. Here are its components:

- **Damage:** The potential impact of a threat, scored on a scale of 0–10.
- **Reproducibility:** The complexity of reproducing the threat, scored 0–10.
- **Exploitability:** How easily the threat can be exploited, scored 0–10.
- **Affected Users:** The number of users impacted, scored 0–10.
- **Discoverability:** The ease of discovering the threat, scored 0–10.

**PASTA**

PASTA stands for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis. It aligns technical requirements with business objectives and provides a strategic view of threats. PASTA's seven stages are:

- **Define Objectives:** Establish the scope and objectives.
- **Define Technical Scope:** Create architectural diagrams to map the attack surface.
- **Decomposition & Analysis:** Map trust boundaries and evaluate vulnerabilities.
- **Threat Analysis:** Identify potential threats based on intelligence.
- **Vulnerabilities & Weaknesses Analysis:** Assess and mitigate weaknesses.
- **Attack/Exploit Enumeration & Modelling:** Simulate attack paths and vulnerabilities.
- **Risk Impact Analysis:** Document risks and propose mitigation steps.


**Answer the questions below**

> What threat modelling methodology assigns a rating system based on risk probability?
> 

DREAD

> What threat modelling methodology is built upon the CIA triad?
> 

STRIDE

> What threat modelling methodology helps align technical requirements with business objectives?
> 

PASTA

#### **Task 5 - Secure Coding**

**Code review** can be done manually or automated. A manual code review is where an expert analyses and checks the source code by going line by line to identify vulnerabilities.  

**Code Analysis:** Automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) automatically analyses and checks the source code.  **SAST** means Static Application Security Testing, a white box testing method that directly analyses the source code. SAST is used to scan source code for security vulnerabilities. Another type of testing goes hand in hand with SAST, Software Composition Analysis (SCA). 

**SCA:** SCA is used to scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities, helping development teams track and analyse any open-source component brought into a project. SCA is now an essential pillar in security testing as modern applications are increasingly composed of open-source code. 

**DAST** Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a black-box security testing methodology that simulates external, automated attacks against running web applications in production environments to discover runtime vulnerabilities without prior knowledge of the source code.

**IAST** Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) is a runtime security testing methodology deployed on application servers that combines aspects of static and dynamic analysis to detect vulnerabilities and pinpoint exact source code line numbers in real time.

**RASP** Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) is a production-tier security technology integrated directly into application runtimes to monitor inward and outward traffic behavior, analyze user actions, and automatically block active attacks in real time.

**Choosing tools:** Complementary Application Security Testing (AST) methodologies—integrating static analysis (SAST), dynamic runtime scanning (DAST), and interactive agent verification (IAST)—collaborate across the software development lifecycle to provide continuous, multi-layered risk discovery, validation, and automated security gating within DevSecOps pipelines. 

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) evaluates third-party open-source components and dependency trees to detect known vulnerabilities and enforce legal license compliance, enabling automated governance and risk mitigation throughout the software development lifecycle.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) are strategically positioned on the right side of the CI/CD pipeline within pre-production staging environments where application execution occurs, whereas Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) is deployed directly in production to oversee runtime behavior and protect live environments.

**Answer the questions below**

> Is it recommended to use SAST analysis at the beginning of the SDLC?
> 

YES

> Which type of code analysis uses the black-box method?
> 

DAST

> Which type of code analysis uses the white-box method?
> 

SAST

#### **Task 6 - Security Assessments**

A security assessment plays a primary role in achieving security in SDLC and should be implemented in all phases where possible. Security testing assesses a system, software or web application for vulnerabilities and other attack vectors.

**Vulnerability Assessment**

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| • Suitable for quickly identifying potential vulnerabilities | • Can produce a large number of reports |
| • Part of the Penetration Test | • Quality depends on the tool used |
| • Better for Budget, they are cheaper than Pentests | • Real-life scenarios for vulnerabilities are not considered (it could be behind a proxy or only exploitable with social engineering/credentials) |
|  | • The low-risk vulnerability may be used as part of a more powerful attack. |

**Penetration testing**

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Tester shows organisations what an attacker could do. | Very Expensive |
| How any vulnerabilities could be used against it by attackers – the real risk | Requires extensive planning and time to carry out the tests |
| Can be shown to the customer |  |

**Answer the questions below**

> Which form of assessment is more budget-friendly and takes less time?
> 

Vulnerability Assessment

> Which type of assessment identifies vulnerabilities and attempts to exploit them?
> 

Penetration Testing

> When do you typically carry out Vulnerability Assessments or Pentests?
> 

Operations & Maintenance

#### **Task 7 - SSDLC Methodologies**

**SSDLC Methodologies:** There are several methodologies for SDLC; some examples of widely used methodologies are:

- Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
- OWASP Secure Software Development Life Cycle Project (S-SDLC)
- Software Security Touchpoints

The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) enforces mandatory, phase-specific security activities, in-process compliance metrics, You can implement SDL by following these practices:

| **Practice** | **Why?** |
| --- | --- |
| **Provide Training** | Engineers, program and product managers must understand security basics and know how to build security into software and services to make products more secure while still addressing business needs and delivering user value.Practical training will complement and re-enforce security policies, SDL practices, standards, and software security requirements and be guided by insights derived through data or newly available technical capabilities. |
| **Define Security Requirements** | Considering security and privacy is a fundamental aspect of developing highly secure applications and systems. Regardless of the development methodology being used, must continually update security requirements to reflect changes in required functionality and changes to the threat landscape. |
| **Define Metrics and Compliance Reporting** | It is essential to define the minimum acceptable levels of security quality and hold engineering teams accountable for meeting those criteria. Defining these early helps a team understand risks associated with security issues, identify and fix security defects during development, and apply the standards throughout the entire project. |
| **Perform Threat Modeling** | This practice allows development teams to consider, document, and discuss the security implications of designs in their planned operational environment and in a structured fashion. Applying a structured approach to threat scenarios helps a team more effectively and less expensively identify security vulnerabilities, determine risks from those threats, make security feature selections and establish appropriate mitigations. |
| **Establish Design Requirements** | The SDL is typically thought of as assurance activities that help engineers implement "secure features", in that the features are well-engineered concerning security. Engineers will normally rely on security features, such as cryptography, authentication, logging, etc. In many cases, the selection or implementation of security features has proven so complicated that design or implementation choices are likely to result in vulnerabilities. Therefore, it's crucially essential to apply these consistently and with a consistent understanding of their protection. |
| **Define and Use Cryptography Standards** | It's critically important to ensure all data, including security-sensitive information and management and control data, is protected from unintended disclosure or alteration when transmitted or stored. Encryption is typically used to achieve this. E.g., only use industry-vetted encryption libraries and ensure they're implemented to allow them to be easily replaced if needed. |
| **Manage the Security Risk of Using Third-Party Components** | When selecting third-party components to use, it's essential to understand the impact of a security vulnerability on the security of the more extensive system into which they are integrated. Having an accurate inventory of third-party components and a plan to respond when new vulnerabilities are discovered will go a long way toward mitigating this risk. |
| **Use Approved Tools** | Define and publish a list of approved tools and their associated security checks, such as compiler/linker options and warnings. Engineers should strive to use the latest version of approved tools, such as compiler versions, and take advantage of new security analysis functionality and protections. |
| **Perform  Security Testing (SAST, DAST, IAST)** | Analysing the source code before compilation provides a highly scalable method of security code review and helps ensure that secure coding policies are being followed. The same goes for performing run-time verification of your fully compiled or packaged software checks functionality that is only apparent when all components are integrated and running. |
| **Perform Security Assessments: Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing** | The objective of a penetration test is to uncover potential vulnerabilities resulting from coding errors, system configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses. As such, the test typically finds the widest variety of vulnerabilities. |
| **Establish a Standard Incident Response Process** | Preparing an Incident Response Plan is crucial for helping to address new threats that can emerge over time. The plan should include whom to contact in case of a security emergency and establish the protocol for security servicing, including methods for code inherited from other groups within the organisation and for third-party code.  |

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open, flexible framework that enables organizations to evaluate, formulate, and iteratively improve their software security practices by defining measurable security activities and maturity goals tailored to their specific risk profiles.

The Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) is an empirical framework derived from real-world software security initiatives that serves as an observational measuring stick, enabling organizations to evaluate their security posture against industry peers and benchmark their existing practices.
